_In this section, Professor Karen Willcox shares her insights about co-teaching_ 16.90 Computational Methods in Aerospace Engineering_._

Embracing Different Teaching Styles
-----------------------------------

{{< quote "[W]e saw our different teaching styles as a positive aspect of the course because it meant we could reach students who had different learning preferences." "— Karen Willcox" >}}

During the Spring 2014 offering of _16.90 Computational Methods in Aerospace Engineering_, I co-taught the course with [Professor Qiqi Wang](http://aeroastro.mit.edu/faculty-research/faculty-list/qiqi-wang). We didn’t just divide the the course and each teach one half. We taught the whole course as a team. Even though we have different teaching styles (for example, I like to use the board when I’m working with students, whereas Professor Wang prefers to use an iPad and pen), we didn’t try to provide students with a uniform pedagogical experience. Instead, we saw our different teaching styles as a positive aspect of the course because it meant we could reach students who had different learning preferences.

Offering Students Perspectives from Different Research Backgrounds
------------------------------------------------------------------

I think co-teaching enhances the learning experience for students. Because Professor Wang and I have different research backgrounds, we were able to offer students different perspectives on computational methods. This is particularly important in an advanced elective class like _16.90 Computational Methods in Aerospace Engineering._
