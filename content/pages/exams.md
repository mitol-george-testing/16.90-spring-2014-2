There are two exams: An oral midterm and an oral final. Individual times for the exams are based on preferences from each student. Each exam will be assigned a letter grade based on the standard MIT letter grade descriptions. Discussing any aspect of an oral exam (whether content or style) outside of the examination room is strictly prohibited!

Below are examples of the midterm and final exam questions from previous semesters.
