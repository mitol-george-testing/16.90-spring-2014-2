When the ODE's are nonlinear, implicit methods require the solution of a nonlinear system of algebraic equations at each iteration. To see this, consider the use of the trapezoidal method for a nonlinear problem,

| \\\[v^{n+1} = v^ n + \\frac{1}{2}{\\Delta t}\\left\[f(v^{n+1},t^{n+1})+f(v^ n,t^ n)\\right\].\\\] | (1.127) 

We can define the following residual vector for the trapezoidal method,

| \\\[R(w) \\equiv w - v^ n -\\frac{1}{2}{\\Delta t}\\left\[f(w,t^{n+1})+f(v^ n,t^ n)\\right\].\\\] | (1.128) 

Thus, \\(v^{n+1}\\) for the trapezoidal method is given by the solution of,

| \\\[R(v^{n+1}) = 0,\\\] | (1.129) 

which is a nonlinear algebraic system of equations for \\(v^{n+1}\\).

One of the standard methods for solving a nonlinear system of algebraic equations is the Newton-Raphson method. It begins with an initial guess for \\(v^{n+1}\\) and solves a linearized version of \\(R=0\\) to find a correction to the initial guess for \\(v^{n+1}\\). So, define the current guess for \\(v^{n+1}\\) as \\(w^ m\\) where \\(m\\) indicates the sub-iteration in the Newton-Raphson method. Note, common useage is to call the iterations in the Newton-Raphson solution for \\(v^{n+1}\\) sub-iterations since these are iterations which occur within every time iteration from \\(n\\) to \\(n+1\\). To find the correction, \\(\\Delta w\\), where

| \\\[w^{m+1} = w^ m + \\Delta w,\\\] | (1.130) 

we linearize and solve the nonlinear residual equation,

| &nbsp; | \\(\\displaystyle R(w^{m+1})\\) | \\(\\displaystyle =\\) | \\(\\displaystyle 0, \\nonumber\\) | &nbsp; | (1.131) |
| &nbsp; | \\(\\displaystyle R(w^ m + \\Delta w)\\) | \\(\\displaystyle =\\) | \\(\\displaystyle 0, \\nonumber\\) | &nbsp; | (1.132) |
| &nbsp; | \\(\\displaystyle R(w^ m) + \\left.\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial w}\\right&#124;\_{w^ m} \\Delta w\\) | \\(\\displaystyle =\\) | \\(\\displaystyle 0, \\nonumber\\) | &nbsp; | (1.133) |
| &nbsp; | \\(\\displaystyle \\left.\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial w}\\right&#124;\_{w^ m} \\Delta w\\) | \\(\\displaystyle =\\) | \\(\\displaystyle -R(w^ m). \\label{equ:NRsystem}\\) | &nbsp; | (1.134) 

This last line is a linear system of equations for the correction since \\({\\partial R}/{\\partial w}\\) is a \\(d \\times d\\) matrix when the original ODE's are a system of \\(d\\) equations. For example, for the trapezoidal method,

| \\\[\\left.\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial w}\\right&#124;\_{w^ m} = I - \\frac{1}{2}{\\Delta t}\\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial w}\\right&#124;\_{w^ m}.\\\] | (1.135) 

Usually, the initial guess for \\(v^{n+1}\\) is the previous iteration, i.e. \\(w^0 = v^ n\\). So, the entire iteration from \\(n\\) to \\(n+1\\) has the following form,

1.  Set initial guess: \\(w^0 = v^ n\\) and \\(m=0\\).
    
2.  Calculate residual \\(R(w^ m)\\) and linearization \\({\\partial R}/{\\partial w}|\_{w^ m}\\).
    
3.  Solve EquationÂ [1.134](javascript: void(0)) for \\(\\Delta w\\).
    
4.  Update \\(w^{m+1} = w^ m + \\Delta w\\).
    
5.  Check if \\(R(w^{m+1})\\) is small. If not, set \\(m \\leftarrow m+1\\) and repeat steps 1 through 4.
